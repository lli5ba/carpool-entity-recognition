Just share the link if you can! In early September my dad was diagnosed with a brain tumor behind his right ear on the brain called Acoustic Neuroma. He had gone undiagnosed and had probably had it for 10-20 years without knowing it. It had grown large enough that it was causing him to have major migrane headaches as well as periodic vision flashes that would last up to 20 seconds. Fortunately it was a benign tumor that would not turn cancerous and could not spread. He had major brain surgery at Palmetto Health Baptist last Wednesday. The surgery took a total of 10 hours. He has been In the hospital since, and was in the ICU until Monday. With him never having any surgery before, he did not react well to all of the anesthesia and sedatives and it took him 5 days to come out of the deep sleep and loopy that he was experiencing. It was not a pretty site to see. I have set up a gofundme page to try to reach out to the community to help them out with their medical expenses. All I am asking is that you share this page/link in everyway you can. He is having to go to speech therapy and see therapists because the surgery left some palsy/paralysis on the side of the face that they operated on. https://www.gofundme.com/s48kmyvw P.S. - He is at home now and getting stronger each and every day! He is doing much better and getting back to his old self! It will take 3-4 months for a full recovery but he should get back soon without any complications, Praise God! Also, He is having to go to speech therapy and see therapists because the surgery left some palsy/paralysis on the side of the face that they operated on.",,,Graham McGee,link,https://www.gofundme.com/s48kmyvw,Click here to support Dad's Brain Surgery Recovery Fund by Graham McGee,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-1,-1,-1,,,,,,,,,,,,

I know this isn't related to rideshare but i'm trying to get the word out to as many USC student as possible. I just wanted to share what happened to my roommate last night when she took a yellow checked cab home. She was in five points and accidentally left her phone in the cab on the way back home. The man driving (when we called the company they said his name was Charles Adams but honestly this may not be his name) came back to our apartment complex and demanded that my roommate get in the car by herself and drive with him to an ATM. He told her that she had to pay him $125 or she wouldn't get her phone back. When the ATM wouldn't let her take out exactly $125 he made her give him $140. He wouldn't let her see the phone until he had the money so she wasn't even certain that he had it but since she was alone with him at that point she didn't want to argue. The cab number was 103 so I would recommend you all avoid that cab if possible. We contacted the cab company but they basically told us they weren't going to do anything about it. PLEASE be cautious taking the free cabs home. I'm sure many of the drivers are kind people but there are also people like this who are only concerned with getting as much money as possible. If any of you have any idea how we can get her money back or at least get this man fired please contact me. My roommate is incredibly upset and I'm not sure what steps we can take to fix this. Thank you!,,,Beth Balog,status,,,85,16,0,85,0,0,0,0,0,-1,-1,-1,,,,,,,,,,,,

Just share the link if you can! In early September my dad was diagnosed with a brain tumor behind his right ear on the brain called Acoustic Neuroma. He had gone undiagnosed and had probably had it for 10-20 years without knowing it. It had grown large enough that it was causing him to have major migrane headaches as well as periodic vision flashes that would last up to 20 seconds. Fortunately it was a benign tumor that would not turn cancerous and could not spread. He had major brain surgery at Palmetto Health Baptist last Wednesday. The surgery took a total of 10 hours. He has been In the hospital since, and was in the ICU until Monday. With him never having any surgery before, he did not react well to all of the anesthesia and sedatives and it took him 5 days to come out of the deep sleep and loopy that he was experiencing. It was not a pretty site to see. I have set up a gofundme page to try to reach out to the community to help them out with their medical expenses. All I am asking is that you share this page/link in everyway you can. https://www.gofundme.com/s48kmyvw P.S. - He is finally going to be able to go home today! He is doing much better and getting back to his old self! It will take 3-4 months for a full recovery but he should get back soon without any complications, Praise God!",,,Graham McGee,link,https://www.gofundme.com/s48kmyvw,Click here to support My dad just had Major Brain Surgery by Graham McGee,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,-1,-1,-1,,,,,,,,,,,,

It doesn't matter if it's in a binder, if it's old, torn, or new. And then as soon as you give me the book I would scan the bar code and it would tell me how much your book is worth and I would give you the cash and then keep your book. It's a lot easier then the bookstore and the amounts are usually higher then what the bookstore is willing to give you! You can message me on Facebook, email me at abby.herschman@gmail.com or text me at 4438601276  to set up an appointment and a time we can meet up and I can meet you anywhere on campus! And I'm a student too so I understand the stress of finals week and this is one less thing you have to worry about! And I will be available from now until early on Saturday the 13th to buy books!

I know this isn't related to looking for rides but I am looking for a 2nd roommate. I live in a 3 bedroom, 2 bathroom house over in Cayce. It's close to pointe west and about a minute or two driving to bilo and CVS. Rent is $450 which includes all utilities (including internet, basic cable and alarm system). It's less than a year old and is also right by the river walk! Includes washer/dryer. Furniture is provided for the living room, kitchen and shower curtain is provided in the bathroom. Floors are wooden throughout the house. Great appliances and great kitchen. Me and my roommate are both pharmacy students so we are going to be studying and working quite a lot but still like to have fun! My other roommate is going to be going into her P1 year next year and I'll be going into my P2 year. If you are interested or would like some pictures you can comment, message me or call or text me (I'll message my number to you).",,,Laura Joseph,status,,,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-1,-1,-1,,,,,,,,,,,,

Please don't forget to invite your friends. With more members there will no doubt be more rides to give. Want to travel anywhere around South Carolina? Maybe Charleston, Greenville, or somewhere in Georgia without spending a fortune on gas or flights, and with some good company? Put up a post if you're driving somewhere another student might want or need to go or if you need a ride and are willing to pitch in for gas! Put the dates you want to leave and return, where specifically you're going/want to go, etc. This group is a great way to find ways to travel cheaper, faster, and to get to know some cool people along the way! Invite everyone you know who goes to USC because the more people that join this group the more likely everyone will be able to find rides and passengers! Bon voyage! Ride Share is a carpool program in many major cities and colleges. If you need a ride post about it on the wall, and the idea is that another University of South Carolina student with planes on going to that same location will carpool with you for little or no cost.

Put the dates you want to leave and return, where specifically you're going/want to go, etc. This group is a great way to find ways to travel cheaper, faster, and to get to know some cool people along the way!
